   * Loading BED/GFF3 peaks file
   * Mapping peaks to closest gene 
   * Visualization of peaks chromosomal positions
   * Visualization of peaks genomic region distribution
   * Human/Mouse regions enrichment within hits
   * Visualization of gene expression distribution within ChIP-Seq hits 
   * Analysis of ChIP-Seq hits enrichment within gene groups
   * Enrichment analysis within ChIP-Seq hits
2) Support for simultaneous analysis of more than one data set (same organism)
